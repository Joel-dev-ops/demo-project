👔 Groovy Scripting Prep Suit – DevOps Edition
This preparation plan is structured in 5 levels, each focusing on real-world DevOps tasks where Groovy is commonly used — especially Jenkins DSL and shared libraries.

🔹 LEVEL 1: Groovy Language Basics (Essentials)
✅ Topics to Learn:
Syntax & Structure

Variables & Data Types

Lists, Maps, Closures

Loops, Conditionals

Functions & Classes

String Interpolation

🧠 Sample Questions:
What’s a closure in Groovy?

How do lists and maps differ in Groovy compared to Python?

🛠️ Practice:
Write a script to iterate over a list of services and print their status.

Create a Groovy function that returns the largest of three numbers.

🔹 LEVEL 2: Jenkins Pipeline with Groovy
✅ Topics to Learn:
Declarative vs Scripted Pipelines

Pipeline syntax (pipeline {}, stages, steps)

Variables in pipelines

Using environment {} and params {}

Retry, timeout, and error handling

Parallel stages

🧠 Sample Questions:
Explain the difference between declarative and scripted pipelines.

How do you pass parameters between pipeline stages?

🛠️ Practice:
Create a Jenkinsfile to:

Checkout code

Run a build

Deploy on success

Add error handling and notification logic

🔹 LEVEL 3: Advanced Groovy for Jenkins
✅ Topics to Learn:
Shared Libraries (vars/, src/, resources/)

Custom pipeline steps

Groovy HTTP client for API calls

File I/O and dynamic pipelines

Using Groovy classes inside Jenkins shared libraries

🧠 Sample Questions:
How would you create a reusable pipeline function for Slack notifications?

What are the advantages of using shared libraries?

🛠️ Practice:
Build a shared library that includes:

A custom notification step

A reusable deployment pipeline

Parameterized build logic

🔹 LEVEL 4: DevOps Tool Integration
✅ Topics to Learn:
API Calls with Groovy (e.g., Jenkins REST API, GitHub, Docker)

Parsing JSON and XML (JsonSlurper, XmlSlurper)

Shell execution inside Groovy scripts (sh, bat)

Groovy with Docker agents in pipelines

🧠 Sample Questions:
How do you parse JSON in Groovy?

How do you trigger an external API call from a Jenkins pipeline?

🛠️ Practice:
Script that:

Reads a JSON config

Pulls and tags a Docker image

Sends results via API to Slack or Mattermost

🔹 LEVEL 5: Best Practices & Real-World Readiness
✅ Topics to Learn:
Using try-catch for robust scripts

Jenkinsfile modularization

Logging and verbosity control

Security best practices in scripted steps

🧠 Sample Questions:
How do you handle secrets and credentials in Jenkins pipelines?

How can Groovy scripts be made more maintainable in DevOps environments?

🛠️ Final Project:
Build a realistic multi-stage Jenkins pipeline that:

Uses parameters and secrets

Calls an external API

Deploys an app via Docker/Kubernetes

Sends a Slack alert with success/failure status
