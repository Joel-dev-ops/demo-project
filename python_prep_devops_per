👔 Python for DevOps: Interview Preparation Suit
This preparation is divided into 5 key domains, each with important topics, sample questions, and practical exercises to help you get truly job-ready.

🔹 1. Python Foundations (Must-Know)
✅ Topics to Cover:
Data types (dict, list, tuple, set)

Loops, conditionals

Functions (with *args, **kwargs)

List comprehensions

String manipulation

Error handling (try-except, finally)

File I/O

🧠 Sample Questions:
What’s the difference between a list and a tuple?

How do you handle exceptions in Python?

Write a function to reverse a string without using slicing.

🛠️ Exercise:
Write a script to parse a .log file and count the frequency of each log level (INFO, ERROR, etc.).

🔹 2. DevOps-Oriented Python Scripting
✅ Topics to Cover:
Working with os, subprocess, shutil, and pathlib

Automating system tasks (disk usage, service status)

Remote execution with paramiko or fabric

Parsing config files (json, yaml, .env)

Scheduling tasks (cron, schedule lib)

🧠 Sample Questions:
How do you run a shell command in Python and capture output?

How would you SCP files to a remote server using Python?

🛠️ Exercise:
Write a script to check disk usage and send an alert email if usage exceeds 90%.

🔹 3. Python & CI/CD Automation
✅ Topics to Cover:
Using Python in Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions

Writing scripts to trigger builds, deployments, or rollbacks

API calls using requests to CI tools or cloud platforms

Docker control via Python (docker-py)

YAML handling for pipelines

🧠 Sample Questions:
How can you use Python to trigger a Jenkins build?

Write a Python script to validate a docker-compose.yml file.

🛠️ Exercise:
Build a Python script that updates a Kubernetes deployment YAML file and pushes changes to Git.

🔹 4. Infrastructure & Monitoring Integration
✅ Topics to Cover:
AWS SDK (boto3) for managing EC2, S3, IAM

Monitoring with Prometheus APIs or alert parsing

Using Python for Ansible custom modules

Log parsing and reporting

🧠 Sample Questions:
How would you use Python to list all EC2 instances in a specific region?

Can you use Python to create a CloudWatch alert?

🛠️ Exercise:
Create a script that retrieves CPU usage metrics from Prometheus and prints them as a chart (use matplotlib).

🔹 5. Code Quality, Testing & Best Practices
✅ Topics to Cover:
Writing testable scripts (unittest, pytest)

Code style (PEP8, flake8, black)

Packaging scripts for reuse (setup.py, requirements.txt)

Logging (logging module)

Environment management (virtualenv, venv, pipenv)

🧠 Sample Questions:
How do you structure a Python project?

What's the difference between pytest and unittest?

🛠️ Exercise:
Refactor one of your DevOps scripts to include:

Logging

Unit tests

Config file for parameters
